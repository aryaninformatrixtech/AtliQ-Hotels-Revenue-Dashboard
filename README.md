About Dataset
This Dashboard is made against a Resume Project Challenge from CodeBasics. 
We are given a dataset of Atliq Grands which owns 5 star hotels across India.
We need to prepare a Dashboard, analyze the data & generate some insights
for the stakeholders of Atliq Grands based on which they can take strategic decisions to improve its business.


Atliq Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years.
Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management,
Atliq Grands are losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. 
As a strategic move, the managing director of Atliq Grands wanted to incorporate
“Business and Data Intelligence” in order to regain their market share and revenue.
However, they do not have an in-house data analytics team to provide them with these insights.
